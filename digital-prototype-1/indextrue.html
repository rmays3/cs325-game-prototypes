<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The hardest part, by far, was trying to implement all the mechanics I wanted for the first time.  Phaser's a strange thing to use.  I should have looked at the tutorials more.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Base example and star asset: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/starstruck">Phaser example:Starstruck</a></li>
<li>Fire rate and weapon code: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/weapon/fire-rate">Phaser example: Fire Rate</a></li>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Starstruck
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Play as the action-geologist Polygonman as he tries to find the Sacred Volcano Stars that may or may not exist.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Geologist
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Basic physics, trying to implement collectibles and movement toward the cursor
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will go "Wow, nice little prototype you got there!"
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players can use the left and right arrow keys to move, and the up arrow to jump.  Pressing the space bar activates Polygonman's invisible blaster, which propells him upward for a little. You can use this to glide across gaps and get up to high places, but be careful! He only has so much of the stuff...
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect that the player has masterful hand-eye coordination and has brought a computer to play this on.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Were we supposed to add this 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

</ul>
