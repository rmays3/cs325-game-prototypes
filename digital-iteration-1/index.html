<h2>"What You See"</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
In this game, some objects only exist when you tell them to.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Detection disables for objects based on the bounds of a rotating rectangle.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how overlapping in arcade physics works in Phaser, and that I need to create more complicated functions if I want the sight mechanic to work exactly as I intend.

</ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Look at objects to activate them and traverse the stage.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Iteration, no theme was added
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Keyboard
Randomness: No randomness
Genre: Platformer, Puzzle
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Can I enable and disable collision on objects?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will experience satisfaction after besting a tricky puzzle using the sight mechanic and getting to the goal.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players can move the character around with the left and right arrow keys, or with the A and D keys.  This character can also jump with the up arrow or W keys.  To change the character's line of sight to the left, use the Z or O keys.  To change it to the right, use the X or P keys.

While playing this game, you will see three different colors of objects.  Blue objects are called "Laws."  They exist whether the player sees them or not.  Green and red objects are "Booleans."  If a Boolean is green, collision on the object is disabled.  If the Boolean is red, collision on the object is enabled.  The player can make a Boolean red by looking in its general direction.  They can also make a Boolean green by looking to the opposite way.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will need to think carefully about what collisions need to be toggled on or off.  Players can turn Booleans on to use them as platforms, for example, or turn them off whenever they want to fall through the floor or go left or right without being blocked.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You're a mining robot on the Blue Planet.  You were assigned on this mission in order to retrieve the yellow crystals that can be found near the planet's core.  These crystals have so much energy stored inside them, they can fuel Earth's electricity worldwide for three years! However, the Blue Planet's caverns can be puzzling, as certain minerals in the mines will disappear is they are not seen.  Can you best the maze and find the crystals?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players of any age will enjoy this game, but younger players will like the bright colors and simple control scheme.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game takes around 3 minutes to play.
