<h2>"X-Treeeme Hamsterball 64"</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's the only game I've seen with underwater hamsters, sports, and three -count them, three- e's in "extreme."  But on a more serious note, a game of catch where you and the ball have to avoid foes was an interesting concept I didn't see much and wanted to explore.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game has the "pass" mechanic relegated to a timer, with the two players taking turns.  Enemies also increase speed for each turn, rather than on each update.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that I should really start these things earlier! But other than that, I also learned how the "weapon" class works with Phaser's Arcade physics, something that was kinda wonky when I just looked at the examples.  Thanks for all your help.  Passing the ball and taking turns was definitely the hardest part.  The easiest was coming up with the game's story to justify all this nonsense.

A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
