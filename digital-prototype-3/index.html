<h2>"X-Treeeme Hamsterball 64"</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's the only game I've seen with underwater hamsters, sports, and three -count them, three- e's in "extreme."  But on a more serious note, a game of catch where you and the ball have to avoid foes was an interesting concept I didn't see much and wanted to explore.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game has the "pass" mechanic relegated to a timer, with the two players taking turns.  Enemies also increase speed for each turn, rather than on each update.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that I should really start these things earlier! But other than that, I also learned how the "weapon" class works with Phaser's Arcade physics, something that was kinda wonky when I just looked at the examples.  Thanks for all your help.  Passing the ball and taking turns was definitely the hardest part.  The easiest was coming up with the game's story to justify all this nonsense.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Pass to your friend, riskier passes get more points!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Caught
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This is a co-op shoot-em-up/sports hybrid game with some randomness in enemy movements.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Can I create a co-op game in Phaser?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should be thrilled as they are under constant tension from Catchers, yet manage to sneak in passes to their friend.  That is the biggest source of satisfaction in all games of Hamsterball.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Player 1 controls the left hamster using WASD.  Player 2 controls their hamster using the arrow keys.  At around three seconds, the hamster who has the Squareball will pass it to the other.  P1 starts with the Squareball.  If the Squareball touches a Catcher, or the hamsters touch a Catcher or the middle line, game over! You get more points based on the distance between each hamster during a successful pass.  But watch out! Not only do enemies speed up after each pass, but so does the ball!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will tend to stick to the middle for survival, or near the ends to rack up a high score.  As enemies and the ball speed up, players will tend to go toward the middle more.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Two hamsters, Hammy and Whammy, love playing Hamsterball in the Hamster Ocean.  Using their Aqua-Domes, the two hamsters pass their Squareball around in hopes of getting the longest passes possible.  But one day, a gang of bullies - the Square Squareball Catchers - appeared and threatened to take their ball away! There was only one thing our hamster heroes could do...play ball!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Kids will love the adorable hamsters and simple gameplay, but otherwise this game appeals to all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game takes around 4 minutes to play.
