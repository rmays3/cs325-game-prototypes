<h2>"Don't Play Games at Work!"</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's the game where not playing at the right time is the key to success!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Gravity increases after the boss leaves, and players can generate a "window" sprite on command.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I mostly learned how timers worked in Phaser, which was the hardest part to do.  Originally I made four timers, when I just needed one.  The most enjoyable part was creating all the assets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Get the high score while your boss isn't looking.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Ice
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse
Randomness: Completely random placement of snowflakes
Genre: Stealth
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Can I pull off more complex timed events?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will experience satisfaction after memorizing the snowflakes' placement and avoiding them all while their screen is obscured.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
While playing Dodge the Snowflakes, the player can move left or right using A, D and the arrow keys.  However, the bar at the top will alert the player whenever their boss draws near.  The player must open a window containing their "work" before that happens.  To do this, they click on the green ! button.  To get out, they click on the red X button.  

However, the Dodge the Snowflakes is still active, so players must memorize where the snowflakes were, how they will land, and how to move accordingly.  If three small snowflakes or one huge one hits the fire, it's game over.  If the player's boss catches them, it's game over.  Watch out: snowflakes fall faster as the game progresses, and the button to open the "work" window moves randomly!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
In order to minimize their time not seeing the screen, the player can estimate how long the "warning" and "boss here" phases are and pull up the "work" screen at the nick of time.  More cautious players can pull up the screen earlier, but this puts the fireball at risk.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You were just hired at The Company Enterprises, where you type things into computers for a very large paycheck.  But one day, a hot new game called "Dodge the Snowflakes" catches your eye.  You play it every morning, every night, even during work! But if the boss catches you playing it, your job is finished! Can you balance work and play?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players of any age will relate, but younger audiences will appreciate the game's primary colors and "cute" player character.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game takes around 3 minutes to play.
